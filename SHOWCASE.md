## Active forks

A snapshot of the operators currently running their own Aeon instance. "Active" means the fork pushed within the last 30 days. Source: weekly `fork-contributor-leaderboard` and `skill-leaderboard` runs against the GitHub forks API.

| Fork | Skills enabled | What it focuses on |
|------|---------------:|--------------------|
| [tomscaria/aeon](https://github.com/tomscaria/aeon) | 94 | The full catalog — nearly every shipped skill turned on. Single largest customizer in the fleet; accounts for the majority of all enabled skill slots across all active forks. |
| [maacx2022/aeon](https://github.com/maacx2022/aeon) | 15 | A curated mid-size profile — picks a subset across research, code, and crypto rather than running everything. |
| [DannyTsaii/aeon](https://github.com/DannyTsaii/aeon) | 3 | Content-leaning starter: `heartbeat` + `digest` + `idea-capture`. First fork to drive `digest` and `idea-capture` onto the leaderboard. |
| [davenamovich/aeon](https://github.com/davenamovich/aeon) | 3 | A small, deliberate selection — uses Aeon as a low-touch personal automation. |
| [0xfreddy/aeon](https://github.com/0xfreddy/aeon) | 2 | Ships a fork-only custom skill (`macos-apps`) alongside heartbeat — first fork to add a local-context skill that doesn't exist upstream. |
| [pezetel/aeon](https://github.com/pezetel/aeon) | 2 | `heartbeat` + `github-trending` — a focused dev-pulse instance. The first fork to break `github-trending` out of the long tail. |
| [UIZorrot/aeon](https://github.com/UIZorrot/aeon) | 1 | Careful Finance fork - uses Aeon/GitHub Actions as the scheduled market-analysis layer behind a public DeFi-yield and perp-arb ChatUI. |

The full ranking — including the per-week skill-divergence buckets and the contributor leaderboard — is regenerated every Sunday by the `fork-skill-digest` and `fork-contributor-leaderboard` skills, with the latest output published to [`articles/`](articles/).

### What forks teach upstream

The fleet is **infrastructure-first**: 18 of 24 active forks run only `heartbeat`. Of the rest, the most common second skills are `github-trending`, `morning-brief`, and the crypto cluster (`token-alert`, `token-movers`, `token-report`). When two or more forks independently flip the same default, the `fork-skill-digest` skill flags it as a `DEFAULT_FLIP` candidate and surfaces it for upstream consideration.

If you're spinning up a new fork, the leaderboard is the cheapest map of what other operators have already validated.

## How Aeon compares

Aeon is one of many ways to build agentic systems. Here's where it sits next to the other tools developers commonly evaluate.

|  | **Aeon** | AutoGen | CrewAI | n8n | LangGraph |
|--|----------|---------|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Runtime** | GitHub Actions | Local / cloud | Local / cloud | Self-hosted or SaaS | Local / cloud |
| **Scheduling** | Cron, native to runtime | Caller decides | Caller decides | Built-in cron triggers | Caller decides |
| **Skill format** | Plain Markdown (`SKILL.md`) | Python classes & agents | Python crews & tasks | Visual JSON nodes | Python `StateGraph` |
| **Persistent memory** | File-based, version-controlled | Per-session unless wired | Per-session unless wired | Per-workflow execution state | Graph state per run |
| **Self-healing** | Yes — `heartbeat` + `skill-repair` auto-patch failing skills | No | No | No (workflow re-runs) | No |
| **Quality scoring** | Every run scored 1–5 by Haiku | No | No | No | No |
| **Reactive triggers** | Yes — `schedule: "reactive"` fires on conditions | Event hooks (manual) | No | Webhook nodes | No |
| **Setup floor** | `git clone` + secrets | `pip install` + write code | `pip install` + write code | Docker or hosted account | `pip install` + write code |
| **Hosting cost** | Free on public repos (Actions minutes) | Pay for compute | Pay for compute | Self-host or pay SaaS | Pay for compute |
| **Operator role** | Configure once, walk away | Build & run orchestration | Build & run crews | Build & maintain workflows | Build & run graphs |
| **External integration** | MCP server + A2A gateway | Function-calling agents | Tool-use API | 400+ pre-built integrations | Tool-use API |

### One-line summary

- **AutoGen** — Microsoft's multi-agent conversation framework. Best when you need multiple LLMs negotiating in a loop, in code you fully control.
- **CrewAI** — Role-based crews with task hand-offs. Best when you're modelling a team (researcher + writer + critic) and want each role to be a discrete agent.
- **n8n** — General-purpose visual workflow tool with a vast integration catalog. Best when the bottleneck is connecting SaaS APIs together, not the LLM step itself.
- **LangGraph** — Stateful graph orchestration over LangChain. Best when your workflow has explicit state machines, branching, and replay needs.
- **Aeon** — A configured-and-forgotten background agent on GitHub Actions. Best when the work is *recurring* (daily briefs, monitoring, PR reviews, research digests) and you want it to run without you, score itself, and patch itself when it breaks.

The real distinction is *operator posture*. AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph are libraries you build *with*. n8n is a workflow editor you build *in*. Aeon is a runtime you point at a goal and leave alone — the cron, the memory, the self-healing, and the public dashboard come included.

If you need an agent you watch, pick one of the others. If you need an agent that watches itself, this is the lane.

## Add yourself

Running an Aeon fork that should be on this page? Open a PR adding a row to the **Active forks** table. The weekly `fork-skill-digest` and `fork-contributor-leaderboard` skills automatically pick up active forks from the GitHub API; this page links the human-readable summary.

For the comparison table, corrections from maintainers of the listed frameworks are welcome — open an issue or a PR.
